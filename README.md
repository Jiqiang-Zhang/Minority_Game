# Project Name
DRLP-Minority-game-code

## Project Description
This project provides basic code for the paper "Dual Reinforcement Learning Synergy in Resource Allocation: Emergence of Momentum Strategy", enabling users to reproduce the relevant results presented in the article. The program can be utilized to explore the synergistic effect between two reinforcement learning policies, as discussed in the aforementioned paper.

## Installation Guide
1. Ensure you have a gfortran compiler installed on your computer.
2. Download the project code.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Compile the code:
gfortran -o DMGP source_code.f90
5. Run the program: ./DMGP
## Usage Example
After running the program, you will generate a text file named 'result.txt,' which contains the relation between the volatility of the capacity and the fraction of C-subpopulation under one simulation run. The resulting data is visualized in Fig.1(a).
