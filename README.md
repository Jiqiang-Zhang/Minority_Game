In the website https://github.com/Jiqiang-Zhang/Minority_Game/blob/main/source_code.f90, we provide the source code in Fortran to enable others to fully benefit from this research and replicate our findings. 
Specifically, the file is named source_code.f90 contains the code that computes the volatility as a function of fc within the population. The resulting data is then visualized in Fig.1(a).
